 *  UCF COP3330 (Object Oriented Programming) Summer 2021 Assignment 4

Using IntelliJ and Gradle, you will create a GUI-based desktop application to allow a user to manage multiple "todo"-type lists.

For [Part 1] of this assignment, you should have focused on the design elements:  UML Class Diagrams, GUI mock-ups, and pseudocode

Now that you have a completed design, [Part 2] of this assignment will focus on the implementation elements: production and test code. During this process, you will discover problems with your initial design. When these discoveries are made, you will need to go back and refine your initial design to address the problems. These changes must be included in your final submission.
